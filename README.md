This mod adds a recreation of the stardrops from Stardew Valley.

**FEATURES**

*   Adds the stardrop item to the game.
*   It is currently **unobtainable** by natural causes, but this is subject to change at some point in time.
*   Eating a stardrop gives you an extra maximum heart
*   There is a default maximum of 10 extra hearts (configurable).

**CUSTOMIZATION**

There is a config file ("stardrops-common.toml") located in the default instance\config folder that allows you to change the maximum amount of hearts gained from stardrop, and whether or not stardrops give maximum hearts at all (disable this if you want to add your own functionality to this).

**FAQ**

"Fabric please"
- Maybe sometime in the future. But not now.

**CREDITS**
